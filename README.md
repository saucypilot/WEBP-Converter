# WEBP converter
Obsidian is able to be a lightweight note taking app by using markdown. But for a lot of us, we like to pair our markdown notes with images. The problem with images is that they tend to be heavy compared to markdown. PNG, SVG, and JPEG images are heavy and can contribute to bloated amount of storage in your vault. What this plugin does is format images into `.webp`. Web-p is one of the most efficient image format as of today. So storing your images as `.webp` will reduce your vault size, this also means faster loading times. WebP also supports both opaque, transparent, and animated images making it a versatile format for various types of images.
